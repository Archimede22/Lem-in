# Lem-in
A project made in the realm of 42 Paris, we had to implement a variation of Edmun Karp's algorithm in a graph that could have up to thousands of nodes

    usage: ./lem-in [--graphic | --nblines | --paths] < source_file
    source files can be found in test_maps
    When the visualizer is active, press N to advance one turn

We were given 125/100 (maximum grade) for this project.

Made using only malloc, free, exit, open and close and functions from the SDL library for the visualizer.
